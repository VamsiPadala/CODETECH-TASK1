DOMAIN: DATA SCIENCE 
DURATION: DECEMBER TO JANUARY
MENTOR: Neela Santhosh Kumar 
Overview of the project:
the project based on the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Iris dataset:


Project Goal:
To gain insights into the Iris dataset by exploring its features, understanding the distribution of data, observing correlations between features, and identifying any outliers or patterns.

Dataset:
Name: Iris Dataset
Source: Commonly used in machine learning for classification tasks.
Features:
Sepal Length (cm)
Sepal Width (cm)
Petal Length (cm)
Petal Width (cm)
Target: 
Species of Iris (encoded as 0, 1, 2 for Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, Iris virginica respectively)

Tools & Libraries:
Python as the programming language.
Libraries: 
Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy for numerical operations.
Matplotlib for basic plotting.
Seaborn for advanced statistical visualizations.

EDA Process:
Data Loading: 
Load the Iris dataset from scikit-learn's dataset module into a pandas DataFrame.
Basic Data Inspection:
View the first few rows of data to understand its structure.
Check for data types, non-null counts, and summary statistics.
Distribution Analysis:
Use histograms to visualize how each feature's data is distributed.
Correlation Analysis:
Calculate and plot a correlation matrix to see how features relate to one another.
Feature Relationships:
Use a pair plot to visualize relationships between all pairs of features, colored by species for classification insight.
Outlier Detection:
Employ box plots to identify any outliers in the dataset for each feature.

Key Findings:
Distribution: Each feature might show a normal or near-normal distribution with varying means and spreads.
Correlations: There's likely a strong positive correlation between petal length and petal width, suggesting that longer petals tend to be wider.
Species Separation: The pair plot would reveal that species can be visually separated more distinctly using petal dimensions than sepal dimensions, hinting at good predictors for species classification.
Outliers: Box plots might show some outliers, particularly in sepal width, indicating anomalies or data entry errors.

Conclusion:
This EDA provides a foundational understanding of the Iris dataset, which can be crucial for further statistical analysis or machine learning tasks like classification. It helps in identifying which features might be more important for distinguishing between Iris species and prepares the data for more complex analysis or modeling steps.
